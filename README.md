This project was my assignment for Algorithms and Data Structures course. 

Some DS and algorithms I've used for the project

### Data Structures:
- basic string object
- hash table
- priority queue
- graphs
  
### Algorithms:
- dijkstra algorithm
- heap building (for priority queue)

### Building 
Just run make command to build program
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ make
```

### Testing data
There are also testing data available in tests/ catalogue: .in files are the input to the program and corresponding .out are expected outputs.
